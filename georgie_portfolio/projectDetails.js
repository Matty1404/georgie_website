      description: `I created the game of chess from scratch in java. I learnt how to use the JSWING library to create a GUI for the game. After implementing the game, I created the AI, learning about different algorithms and heuristics to optimise it.
      
      You also get the option to play with a friend instead of the AI. The game is new player friendly, not allowing them to make illegal moves, as well as showing them what moves are available to make by highlighting the squares which the chosen piece can move to.
      
      I learnt about mini-max trees and Alpha-Beta pruning for this project. This was a step up from my A level project which also involved chess, except I did not fully utilise the power of object oriented programming.`,

      This skill become useful when I was working at Terra. Here I used my discord.py knowledge to help rebuild their support system. I created a new forum channel, where once a support ticket was complete, a member of Terra could run a command which would automatically filter all sensative infomation and post the useful resolution to the problem for everyone to see.`,

This project was shortlisted as a top 10 project in our year group at Imperial College London.

      I worked on trying to develop the ANN from scratch and I designed and implemented the algorithm for identifying where each note was on the sheet. For this I had to work with arrays of pixels, breaking the problem into subproblems in order to create the algorithm.`,

      We then had to convert our tokens into assembly code. Once we had finished that, we were tasked to choose from a vast variety of different extentions of varying difficulty. For the extentions, I personally tackled control flow analysis, constant propagation analysis and adding additional loop control statements to the language such as break, continue and for loops.
      
      Overall, we were told that our group completely broke the unofficial Imperial record for extensions completed`,

      The aim of this App was to encourage bulk buying between students. Students would be able to request what produce that they wanted to buy, and if enough people bought the produce, it would be discounted.
      
      For this project, I learnt how to use React and make endpoints using Flask, which allowed our application to communicate with the backend. I also learnt to use Firebase, which was were we stored all the data used for this project. We also communicated with real wholesalers to make sure that whatever we were creating would be viable to use`,
